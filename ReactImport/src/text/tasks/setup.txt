Initial Setup of Instance and Attributes

An analysis is dependent on a set of instances
( as set of objects with attribute parameters) and
a set of attributes within these instances.  This menu
set sets up the set of instances and attributes
to be used for the analyses.

Training Set: The set of instances to be used within
    the analyses to 'train', i.e. learn from.
Test Set:     The set of instances to be used to 
    determine how successful the analyses will be
    on future instances.
