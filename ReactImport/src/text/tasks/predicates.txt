Creation of Predicates

Critical Points:

A set of fuzzy partitions (a set of fuzzy predicates)
are created from the critical points.  Several types
of partitions can be created:

LTGT: Less than and greater than the critical point
LTEQGT: Less than, equal and greater than the critical point
EQNE: Equal to  and not equal to the critical point
LTEQEQGT: Less than, equal to (one to one side, one to the other side) and greater than the critical point
