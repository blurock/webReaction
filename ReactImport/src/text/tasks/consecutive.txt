Determining Consecutive Sequences

Sets of instances (given in KeyWords) are examined
to find the 'Consecutive' Sequences.

Sort:  

The reference of 'Consecutiveness' is given by a 
sorted list of instances.  The 'Sort' routines
orders the training set of instances according
to a specified parameter.

Consecutive:

The sorted set of instances is used find
consecutive series in a set of given
instance subsets (the usual source of these
sets are the nodes of a clustering hierarchy).
