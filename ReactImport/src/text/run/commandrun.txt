Run a Command
===============

To manipulate the data or do 
specific analyses, individual
commands (with the current history
and history level) are performed.
With this frame system commands
can be specified directly.

Three levels of how the command will
effect the history level are available:

'Experiment'
The current level is used, but no new 
information is generated.  This is 
basically a debugging mode.

'Change'
The current level of information is
updated by the new command.

'Operate'
The operation is performed on the 
current level and then, when finished,
the new data is written to a new level
(the history level is automatically
updated).
