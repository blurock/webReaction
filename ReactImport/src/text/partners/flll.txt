Fuzzy Logic Laboritorium Linz
Johannes Kepler University, Linz
A-4040 LINZ
Austria



  After 15 years of theoretical research in fuzzy logic, Prof. Erich
  Peter Klement founded the FLLL with the intention of supporting the
  local industry with knowledge in this rather new area. The history
  can be summarized as follows:


     1976: Start of research in fuzzy logic by Prof. Erich Peter Klement

     September 1978: First international Linz Seminar on Fuzzy Set Theory

     November 1991: Lab founded by Prof. Erich Peter Klement

     January 1993: Move to the Softwarepark Hagenberg

     August 1994: Beginning of permanent project business in Hagenberg

     May 1995: Presentation of the Pilot and Demonstration Workplace Fuzzy Logic

     June 1996: Launch of a long-term partnership with SONY DADC Austria and USP - Uni Software Plus


  Out of that history and the intentions leading to the foundation of
  the FLLL we can summarize our goals by the following key phrases:


     Continuation of the basic research activities

     Applied research for industries

     Workshops for engineers, teachers, students, and companies

     Consulting and management of industrial projects
