Johannes Kepler University, Linz

Austria

 RISC-Linz was established by the Austrian
 Government in 1987 and is organizationally a part
 of the Johannes Kepler University in Linz,
 Austria. RISC-Linz is an independent unit but
 operates in close contact with the departments of
 Institute of Mathematics and of the Institute of
 Computer Science.

 RISC-Linz was founded by Prof. Bruno Buchberger;
 its current chairman is Prof. Franz
 Winkler. Research and teaching at the institute is
 carried out by the faculty who provide the
 scientific environment for the graduate
 students. At present, about 70 people (full
 professors, faculty, Ph.D. and diploma students)
 are working at RISC-Linz in the frame of various
 research and development projects.

RISC-Linz is located in the Castle of Hagenberg, a medieval castle 25
km from Linz in the beautiful landscape of the Mühlviertel. This site
combines all the advantages of easy accessibility in the heart of
Austria and the attraction of an ideal working atmosphere for
researchers.
