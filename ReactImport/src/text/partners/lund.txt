he Division of Combustion Physics is since 1991 a separate division
within the Department Of Physics at Lund Institute of Technology. The
scientific activities have a long tradition in developing and applying
laser techniques for combustion diagnostics.  There is also a long
tradition to work in the field of ignition and spark phenomena, mainly
directed towards SI engines. During the last years there has also been
strong activities in the field of theoretical chemical
kinetics. Within the combustion modelling activities there is also
work in the field of turbulent combustion.
