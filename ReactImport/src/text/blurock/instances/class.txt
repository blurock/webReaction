The Class Hierarchy
===================

The 'classes' of the system are the 
data types that are available.  Some 
classes have 'dynamic' information, i.e.
information that is specified at runtime
(for optimal configurability).  Some standard
data classes are specified during the initialization
procedures.

This menu shows the hierarchy of classes
within the system.  

By a click on a given name, the class 
information (usually in plain text form) 
will be given in a new frame.

To see subclasses, click on the symbol to
the left.

Update:  With this button, the current set
         of classes (as determined by the
         history level) are read in.
