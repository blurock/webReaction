Atribute Set
=========
Attributes are the parameters
pertaining to the whole data set.
They can be intermediate results of
analyses or calculations, or they can
be parameters which guide the how an
algorithm is to behave.

This frame is for viewing the current
(as specified by the history level)
set of attributes.

Update:
   The 'Update' button determines the current
   set of attributes (as specified by the history).

   The 'view' button prints the value of the (first)
   highlighted parameter in another frame.
