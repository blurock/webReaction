Read Data
=========

One of the standard ways to input new
data types, attributes and instance attributes
is through reading pre-prepared files.  These
files have two sections, the first deals with
the attributes of the entire run and the second
deals with the attributes of the instances.

Input consists of two files, the 'Class' file, 
where the data types and the specification of 
which parameters are to be read are given and the 
'Attribute' file where the attributes and instances
are actually read in.

Within the class specification file, 
there are two parts to the input.  First, there 
are class (data type) specifications.  This is 
where new dynamic data types are defined, i.e. the
required 'extra' information that is needed to 
complete their specification is given.  The second
part is the specification of which parameters are
going to be read in.  The parameter name and the
data type of the parameter are specified.

Within the attribute file, the actual parameter information
(given in the order of the previous specification).
The input of the run parameters is given first.  Then,
for each instance, the name of the instance and the set 
of parameters are specified.

In the input frame, the two files are specified.  By 
clicking on 'Class File' or 'Attribute File' the 
file can be searched for in the directory system.
Alternatively, the name can be given directly in the field.
