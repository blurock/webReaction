Selecting Instance Attributes
=============================

As analyses proceed, new parameters
can be created or selected out, thus
not all are needed for a particular new
analyses.  With this frame, the set
of attributes within each instance
to be used for the next
analyses is determined.

The left frame is the current set of
attributes within the instances and the
right frame shows the selected attributes.

There are two ways to select the instance
attributes.  Either by selection or by
type specification.  The 'Set Attributes'
button performs the specified operation.

With the 'Set Selected' radio
button, those selected in the left frame
are transfered to the selected set. 

If only those of a certain type are to be used,
then the data types are specified in the 
'Attribute Types' field and the 'Set by
Type' button is selected.
