System Initialization
=====================

The Analysis system consists of
'hard-coded' classes (data types) and
'dynamic' classes.  With this frame
certain 'standard' data types are
built.

The 'Initialize' Button performs
the initialization on the selected
data groups.

All the appropriate initializations
should be done before the analyses 
begin.
