Save Level History
==================

As soon as a set of analyses are
completed, the intermediate results
can be 'saved' and used as the starting
point for the next set of analyses.  For
each operation performed, the newly created
data can either be saved with the parameters
of the current level or the whole 'current' set,
with the new results can be saved in the next level.
In addition, with many operations, a debug
level can be specified (this is especially
useful when inputting new data).

'History Update'
When set, each operation (more or less each
operation 'click' of menus updates to a 
new level.  Otherwise, the current level
is kept.

'Debug'
This slider sets the level of debugging.
To the left, no debug information is 
outputted and to the right the maximum
(there are 5 levels).

'History Name'
Different sets of analyses can be stored
under different names.  What is to be
considered the 'current' set is determined
by the history name and the history level.

'Slider'
The slider shows the current history level.
The level is automatically updated
when appropriate.

'Analysis' or 'Reaction'
There are actually two subsystems, the
'Analysis' system is for doing
machine learning analyses and the
'Reaction' system is for symbolic chemical
applications.
