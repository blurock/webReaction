Molecule Database

This interface is able to view the basic
molecule data that is in the REACT system.
By pressing 'Molecule' 2D structure of the
molecule can be examined.

The molecule database, as used for mechanism
generation, is used to choose the initial molecules for 
the generation and also to have know information about
smaller molecules that could arise in the 
generation process.
