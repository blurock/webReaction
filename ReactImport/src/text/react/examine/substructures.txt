Substructures

This interface is able to view the basic
molecule data that is in the REACT system.
By pressing 'Substructure' 2D structure of the
molecule can be examined.

Substructures are the key to the reaction
patterns in mechanism generation.  If a 
substructure within a reaction pattern is
matched within a molecule, then this molecule
can 'react' with the substructure.
